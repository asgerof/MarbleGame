# MarbleGame Project Analysis

## Project Overview

**MarbleGame** is a 3D marble track building game with the core philosophy of "Build ¬∑ Roll ¬∑ Smile". Players snap modular track pieces onto a 3D grid, press Roll, and watch marbles flow through lifts, cannons, and splitters in a calm, predictable, and endlessly tweakable experience.
